post d dtc X Y

I've found that I can post a specific DS0, or conversely I can post a specific DTC port and use 12/Next to move thru all 24 DS0's, but is there a way to post all 24 DS0's on my screen?

If you want to BSY or RTS an entire T-1, the post it by the port, i.e.

post d dtc 5 4

then type BSY ALL, BSY INB ALL or RTS ALL and it will apply to DS0s on DTC 5 X 4.

If you post it via the CLLI

post g <trunk clli>

and use BSY ALL, BSY INB ALL or RTS ALL, it applies to all members of the trunk group (the DSOs can be on different T-1s.
